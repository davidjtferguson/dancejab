# DanceJab
Simple fighting game. Dashing and jabbing only.

Made with Pico 8.

Two player game - either hook up two controllers or look up Pico 8's keyboard mapping for the second controller on the keyboard.

Left and right to move left and right.

X to jab and O to dash in direction of movement.

Up and down to taunt.

movement:
1. acceleration left and right.
2. Dash - cancels all momentum to a fast dash back or forward.
3. Jab - small punch infront of body. Carries current momentum. Laggy enough to expect to get hit on wiff.

first to three wins.

Small space to play with so trying to control the centre is imperitive. Draws people into the centre to push conflict. Each player wants to keep enough space behind them so that they can dash back if needed.
